The shouldShowOnboardingProvider is a FutureProvider that may still be Loading when the router initializes. When loading, .value returns null which defaults to false, causing the router to skip onboarding incorrectly.\n\n**Fix:** Add a check for ref.read(shouldShowOnboardingProvider).isLoading at the beginning of the redirect function.
