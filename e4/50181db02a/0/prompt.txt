You are the proxy-fix agent. Your task is to fix the ~2000ms TTFB issue on API calls going through Next.js.

## Task from TaskList: #2 — Frontend: Fix Next.js proxy TTFB + trailing slash

## Analysis

The next.config.ts already has rewrites configured:
```typescript
async rewrites() {
    return [{
        source: "/api/v1/:path*",
        destination: "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/:path*",
    }];
}
```

BUT there's `trailingSlash: true` on line 30 of next.config.ts. This causes Next.js to add 307/308 redirects to add trailing slashes to ALL paths, including API paths. Combined with the API client interceptor that ALSO adds trailing slashes (line 82 of client.ts), this creates double-redirect issues.

## What to do

### 1. In `frontend/next.config.ts`:
- REMOVE `trailingSlash: true` (line 30) — this is causing 307 redirects on API paths and adding latency. The i18n routing doesn't need it.

### 2. In `frontend/src/lib/api/client.ts`:
- The trailing slash interceptor on line 82 should STAY — FastAPI routes are defined with trailing slashes and we need them
- No changes needed here

### 3. Verify `frontend/src/proxy.ts`:
- Should NOT be touching API paths — check the matcher excludes `/api`
- Current matcher: `'/((?!api|_next|_vercel|.*\\..*).*)'` — this already excludes api paths, good

## Important
- Read each file FULLY before making changes
- Only remove `trailingSlash: true` from next.config.ts
- Don't change the rewrites config
- Don't touch proxy.ts (it's already correct)
- Don't downgrade any library versions

## When Done
Mark task #2 as completed via TaskUpdate.
