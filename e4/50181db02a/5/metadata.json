    "intent": "Optimize dashboard rendering performance across 6 frontend components by reducing animation delays, simplifying effects, lowering rendering costs, and adding Suspense boundaries.",
    "outcome": "Successfully applied all performance optimizations: reduced 3D scene DPR and particle count, removed stagger delays from animations across multiple components, simplified CypherText to only animate on hover, optimized FPS counter implementation, increased ping measurement interval, and added Suspense boundaries to dashboard page.",

        "The dashboard uses Framer Motion extensively with staggered animation delays that create perceived jank on initial render",
        "The 3D GlobalNetwork scene was using frameloop='demand' incorrectly with OrbitControls autoRotate and useFrame animations, which require frameloop='always'",
